## Letter to YouTube
```
Hello,

Greeting from Attachment Aditya 2021 there,

I am Attachment Aditya, operating Attachment Studios. With this mail, I had a formal request for allowing PackedBerry to be used for Music usage.

PackedBerry is an all-purpose bot, with many commands for fun stuff, moderation, politics(what the audience call it for some reason, I have no idea why they do), utilities, games, DMs and also for listening to YouTube audio. It serves more.

Currently, it is not on many servers and servers with owners ready to test the bot. They recommend talking about Permission for music download and usage so that the efforts made in PackedBerry won't go wasted.

None of the users wants it to be like Rhythm and Groovy. It is a pretty good bot and useful. It is completely open-sourced and free to use.

And hence I would like to request if you permit the bot to use audio from YouTube videos. In case you have any problem, please contact. Maybe we can try to resolve it through my coding knowledge and your YouTube APIs.

Finally, I would like to address the PackedBerry website,

https://PackedBerry.AttAditya.Repl.Co

Till Then.

:D
